            <p class="bio-info"> Hey, I'm Supriya! I'm a full stack developer with proficiency in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I graduated from Columbia University in 2019 with a B.A. in Neuroscience and a minor in Women and Gender Studies. Shortly after, I decided to enroll in Thinkful's Web Development program after a heated and lengthy conversation with a friend (and fellow coder) about the similarities and dissimilarities between the human brain and a computer. It wasn't very long into the course that I realized that I had all the skillsets needed to be a developer: I've always been an independent learner, an avid problem solver, and a great team player. It was also so satisfying to write a few lines of clean code that could solve a complicated question in an instant. I also have an eye for design, so making my pages aesthetically pleasing is very important to me.
                   <br><br>
                My interests outside of coding: I'm very passionate about theatre and film, I love cats, and I self-identify as a plant mom. Give me all your book recommendations!

            <h2>The English Quiz</h2>
            <p>A webpage with a short quiz on the English language, with a little left turn at the end for fun! I used HTML5, CSS, Javascript, jQuery to build this fully responsive, mobile first page. Click <a href="https://authriya.github.io/quiz-app/">here</a> for a link to the live site and <a href="https://github.com/authriya/quiz-app/">here</a> for a link to the GitHub repo.</p>

            <h2>The Rijksmuseum Art Finder</h2>
            <p>An app that allows you to either search art in the Rijksmuseum collection, or find an art object by random. Lets you explore one of the most impressive museums in the world without those expensive plane tickets. I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to design this fully responsive app. In order to get the appropriate data I also used GET requests from the Rijksmuseum API, and even developed a unique random art piece feature.
