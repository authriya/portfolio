            <p class="bio-info"> Hey, I'm Supriya! I'm a full stack developer with proficiency in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I graduated from Columbia University in 2019 with a B.A. in Neuroscience and a minor in Women and Gender Studies. Shortly after, I decided to enroll in Thinkful's Web Development program after a heated and lengthy conversation with a friend (and fellow coder) about the similarities and dissimilarities between the human brain and a computer. It wasn't very long into the course that I realized that I had all the skillsets needed to be a developer: I've always been an independent learner, an avid problem solver, and a great team player. It was also so satisfying to write a few lines of clean code that could solve a complicated question in an instant. I also have an eye for design, so making my pages aesthetically pleasing is very important to me.
                   <br><br>
                My interests outside of coding: I'm very passionate about theatre and film, I love cats, and I self-identify as a plant mom. Give me all your book recommendations!

            <h2>Habit Tracker</h2>
            <p>I developed this app during the coronavirus quarantine in March 2020, in an effort to develop a routine and schedule, but to simultaneously not put too much pressure on myself (and users) while they coped with the quarantine. I wanted to create an app that lets you set tasks that you ideally want to do every day– but doesn't pressure you to do them at any particular time. With this concept in mind, I developed an app that lets you add habits and log your consistency of doing them every day of the week– and lets you start afresh with a clean slate every new week. The timespan of a week to track your habits was the ideal middle ground between taking it one day at a time, and giving yourself a flexible routine.

            <h2>Audition Tracker</h2>
            <p>As an actor, I am all too familiar with the panic of having to keep track of my auditions– who called me in, what role it was for, what I wore, how I thought it went, and so on. These details may seem minor to a non-actor, but they are vital to a working actor– new industry connections and relationships can sometimes be more important than booking a part. I made the Audition Tracker to have this record of auditions and connections you make as a working actor in New York City, that you can refer to in case an agent or casting director wants to know about your recent audition history. Click <a href="https://audition-tracker.now.sh/">here</a> for a link to the live site, <a href="https://github.com/authriya/audition-tracker">here</a> for the Github repo for the frontend, and <a href="https://github.com/authriya/audition-tracker-api">here</a> for the Github repo for the backend</p>

            <h2>The Rijksmuseum Art Finder</h2>
            <p>An app that allows you to either search art in the Rijksmuseum collection, or find an art object by random. Lets you explore one of the most impressive museums in the world without those expensive plane tickets. I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to design this fully responsive app. In order to get the appropriate data I also used GET requests from the Rijksmuseum API, and even developed a unique random art piece feature.

            <h2>The English Quiz</h2>
            <p>A webpage with a short quiz on the English language, with a little left turn at the end for fun!
