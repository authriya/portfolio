            <p class="bio-info"> Hey, I'm Supriya! I'm a full-stack developer with proficiency in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I graduated from Columbia University in 2019 with a B.A. in Neuroscience and a minor in Women and Gender Studies. Shortly after, I decided to enroll in Thinkful's Web Development program after a heated and lengthy conversation with a friend (and fellow coder) about the similarities and dissimilarities between the human brain and a computer. It wasn't very long into the course that I realized that I had all the skillsets needed to be a developer: I've always been an independent learner and an avid problem solver. My years of working in ensemble theatre and then in a restaurant also make me a great team player, which came into handy when collaborating with other programmers on projects. It was also so satisfying to write a few lines of clean code that could solve a complicated question in an instant. I also have an eye for design, so making my pages aesthetically pleasing is very important to me.
                   <br><br>
                My interests outside of coding: I'm very passionate about theatre and film, I love cats, and I self-identify as a plant mom. Give me all your book recommendations!

                <h2>Habit Tracker</h2>
                <p>I developed this app during the coronavirus quarantine in March 2020 to maintain a routine and schedule, but to simultaneously not put too much pressure on myself (and users) while they coped with the quarantine. I wanted to create an app that lets you set tasks that you ideally want to do every day– but doesn't pressure you to do them at any particular time. With this concept in mind, I developed an app that lets you add habits and log your consistency of doing them every day of the week– and lets you start afresh with a clean slate every new week. The period of a week to track your habits was the ideal middle ground between taking it one day at a time and giving yourself a flexible routine.</p>

                <h2>Audition Tracker</h2>
                <p>As an actor, I am all too familiar with the panic of having to keep track of my auditions– who called me in, what role it was for, what I wore, how I thought it went, and so on. These details may seem minor to a non-actor, but they are vital to a working actor– new industry connections and relationships can sometimes be more important than booking a role. I made the Audition Tracker so actors could have this record of auditions and connections you make as a working actor in New York City, that you can refer to in case an agent or casting director wants to know about your recent audition history.

                <h2>The Rijksmuseum Art Finder</h2>
                <p>The Rijksmuseum is one of my favorite art museums in the world– one of my fondest memories from a solo trip in Amsterdam was exploring it. I created this app that allowed the user (and myself) to explore the museum from the comfort of their couch– no pesky plane tickets required. You can either search for art in the Rijksmuseum collection or find an art object by random if you're feeling lucky. I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to design this fully responsive app. I populated the app with data from GET requests to the Rijksmuseum API.

                <h2>The English Quiz</h2>
                <p>I originally made this app as a quiz on the English language, but, after realizing my questions were too simple, I thought it'd be funnier to include a left turn at the end as a joke– just something I may or may not have used to undercut my younger brother's confidence, and you may forward it to the appropriate person who may need to be taken down a peg or two. Jokes aside, it was fun to use my coding skills to comedic effect, and I hope you'll enjoy it as well!
